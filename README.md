## **Hi dear friend** ## 

I'm trying to get the data saved by the **blood monitor pressure(BMP)** but I'm struggling with that because my **logic analizer** has been stolen **two times** from the postal service, I bought it in aliexpress but I haven't been lucky I guess, So I was wondering if you can instruct me on how to get the data from the BMP and to connect to a **Arduino Uno** or an **ESP32**, I think is pretty similar the way to get the data in a **Arduino** than in a **ESP32**. I'm aware that the **EEPROM** in its **I2C** protocol doesn't have pull down resistences already installed in the electronic target as I already have the **BMP**, and also I'm aware that there is a **difference** in voltage from the **ESP32** or **Arduino** form the voltage handled in the **BMP**, so I already bought a bunch of logic level converters.

Do you have the details on the EEPROM and registers addresses to get the data from the **BMP** in the **Arduino**? or what perspective did you use to get the data from the BMP in your android project?
